            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sam Neill Comes Home To A Kiwi Comedy</h1><p>Out of his isolated roots in New Zealand, Sam Neill has emerged as a multifaceted actor, able to tackle villainous roles ("The Piano," "The Tudors"), heroic ones ("Jurassic Park"), and those in between ("Peaky Blinders") with the same aplomb. A self-ascribed travel addict, Neill has worked in nearly three dozen countries and seems keen on upping that number.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5bcf988661b1140ec10704e537f52730e97b940c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Natasha Lyonne's Indie Attitude</h1><p>Natasha Lyonne knows that she sounds like Al Pacino sometimes. And she seems well aware that her "thing" is not easily definable. In fact, she's made a career of it with complex, oddball and wild characters: Vivian in "Slums of Beverly Hills"; Jessica in the "American Pie" franchise; and most recently we've met her as Nicky on Netflix's " Orange Is the New Black."</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9d7daba03d2379729aac8c511d2f5453337db731.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Women of Sundance: What indies can teach Hollywood about equality</h1><p>PARK CITY, Utah - Why are women represented so much better at Sundance than in Hollywood at large? In the broadest of strokes, Sundance movies are written and directed by women at a far greater rate (about a third) than at the studio level (about 3% of the top-grossing films).</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4308cc5e69853c846c27caf87ab1fcaac69f4762.jpg"></article>]]></description>
