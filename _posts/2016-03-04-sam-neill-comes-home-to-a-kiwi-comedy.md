description: 'Out of his isolated roots in New Zealand, Sam Neill has emerged as a multifaceted actor, able to tackle villainous roles ("The Piano," "The Tudors"), heroic ones ("Jurassic Park"), and those in between ("Peaky Blinders") with the same aplomb. A self-ascribed travel addict, Neill has worked in nearly three dozen countries and seems keen on upping that number.'
