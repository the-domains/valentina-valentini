about

I've been a freelance journalist for seven years, mainly focused on the entertainment industry. I have been published with Vanity Fair, Vice, Los Angeles Times, Vulture, Variety, Mashable, Boston Magazine, LA Magazine and many more. I cover film festivals, awards season, business, technology, I interview directors and actors and cinematographers, costume designers and editors too; there's nothing about motion pictures that doesn't fascinate me and excite the inner child-glued-to-the-TV. More recently, I've published some adventure and travel pieces, and will be digging up more as I take off from LA to join the Digital Nomads of the freelance and creative world.
