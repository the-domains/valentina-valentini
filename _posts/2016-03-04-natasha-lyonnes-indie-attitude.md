description: "Natasha Lyonne knows that she sounds like Al Pacino sometimes. And she seems well aware that her \"thing\" is not easily definable. In fact, she's made a career of it with complex, oddball and wild characters: Vivian in \"Slums of Beverly Hills\"; Jessica in the \"American Pie\" franchise; and most recently we've met her as Nicky on Netflix's \" Orange Is the New Black.\""
