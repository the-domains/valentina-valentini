about

I've been a freelance journalist for seven years, mainly focused on the entertainment industry. I write for magazines and websites including Vanity Fair, Vulture, Variety, Mashable, Boston Magazine, LA Magazine and many more. I cover film festivals, awards season, business, technology and beyond. More recently, I've published some adventure and travel pieces, and will be digging up more as I take off from LA.
